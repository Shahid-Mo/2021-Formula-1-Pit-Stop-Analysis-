# 2021 Formula 1 Pit Stop Analysis 

## Overview

This repository houses an in-depth analysis focused on the pit stops during the 2021 Formula 1 season, examining how changes in pit stop rules and strategies influenced race outcomes and team performances. Split into two primary Jupyter notebooks titled "2021 Pitstop Rule 1" and "Complete Analysis," the project provides a detailed exploration of team strategies, driver efficiency, and the overarching impact of pit stop regulations through various races and conditions.

## Datasets

The project leverages a wide array of datasets to conduct a thorough analysis:

- `pit_stops.csv`: Records of pit stop details, including timings, associated race, and driver.
- `races.csv`: Information on each race, including date and location.
- `drivers.csv` and `constructors.csv`: Profiles and information on drivers and teams, respectively.
- `lap_times.csv` and `qualifying.csv`: Data on lap times and qualifying rounds for performance analysis.
- `circuits.csv`: Information on the circuits where the races took place.
- `constructor_results.csv` and `constructor_standings.csv`: Results and standings of the teams throughout the season.
- `driver_standings.csv`: Standings of the drivers over the season.
- `results.csv`: Comprehensive results of each race, including positions and points.
- `seasons.csv`: Historical context and information about each Formula 1 season.
- `sprint_results.csv`: Results from the sprint qualifying sessions.
- `status.csv`: Status codes that explain the reason behind a driver's result (e.g., Finished, Mechanical Failure, Crash).

These datasets provide a rich foundation for analyzing pit stop strategies, driver and team performances, and the implications of rule changes on the competitive landscape of Formula 1.

## Notebooks

### 2021 Pitstop Rule 1

Focused on the implications of specific pit stop rules introduced or emphasized in the 2021 season, this notebook analyzes how teams navigated these regulations and their impact on race strategies and outcomes.

### Complete Analysis

A broader examination of the season, evaluating how pit stop strategies correlate with race outcomes and performance metrics across various circuits and conditions.

## How to Use

Clone the repository and ensure your Python environment is set up to run Jupyter Notebooks. The analysis relies on Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for data manipulation, numerical calculations, and visualizations, respectively.
